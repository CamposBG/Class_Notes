            <b>Ecotoxicity</b>,the subject of study of the field of ecotoxicology (a portmanteau of ecology and
            toxicology),
            refers to the potential for biological, chemical or physical stressors to affect ecosystems. Such stressors
            might
            occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural
            biochemistry,
            physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem.

            Ecotoxicology has been defined as, "the branch of toxicology concerned
            with the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity">toxic</a> effects, caused by natural or
            synthetic pollutants,
            to the constituents of ecosystems.

            In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and environmental hazards associated
            with their
            cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the

        Basically it's just a way to group content together to threat it mimilarly or to do 
        something with it. For instance, to insert a border around an image and the legend at the same time,

        It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.
