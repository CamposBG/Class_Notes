EXPRESS
********
Express is a node package that does a lot for us. It is a web dev framework
It help us to:
    - Start up a server to listen for requests
    - Parde incoming requests
    - Match those requests to particular routes 
    - Craft our http response and associated content 

Library vs framework:
    - Library: When you use a library, you are in charge!, You control the flow, of the application code, and you decide when to use the library.
    - framework: with frameworks, that control is inverted. The framework is in charge, and you are maraly a participant. The frame work tells you where to plug in  the code.
        - You are writing your code according to how the framework works and you're following the rules.


nodemon is a package that autonatically reset the server when changes are made.
