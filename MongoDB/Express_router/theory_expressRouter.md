# Express Router

> Documentation: http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.router

The function:

```
express.Router([options])
```

Creates a new router onbject for us. A Router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. Think of it as a mini application that has some routes, maybe some middleware that we then combine with other Routers to build up our full application.

Basically we cam break up our routes into separate files.node_modules
