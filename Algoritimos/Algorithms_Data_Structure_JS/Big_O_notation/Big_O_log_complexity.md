Besides the most common complexities **O(1), O(n) and O(n²)** we have logarithms expressions
>Log2(value) = exponent    ⇒  2^exponent = value  

Regarding **Big O**  the base of the log does not matters, we just care about the **general trend**

>**A very basic Rule of Thumb:**
>The log of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2  ** before you get a value that's less than or equal to one**

**Log Time Complexity algorithms O(log*n*) are great ~ fast**
